Today was the "testing phase" of the project. From what I can tell, Waldo sourced his code (or the reverse) from:
https://realpython.com/python-sockets/

Two files were created today:
- server.py
    - main loop
    - accept wrapper
    - service connection
- client.py
    - main loop
    - start connection
    - server connection

Logging has been set up with time stamps.

You run each with the following commands for testing:
"python3 server.py 127.0.0.1 65432"
"python3 client.py 127.0.0.1 65432"

You are currently able to send messages from client to server, and the server can respond.
It might be worth spending time abstracting a lot for our protocol and creating a "protocol.py" file for parsing functions.

Started today's work by creating "setup.py"
This will reset our database and set up schema for use. We decided on two tables:
- users
  - user_id (primary)
  - username
  - pass_hash

- messages
 - message_id (primary)
 - sender_id
 - recipient_id
 - message
 - time (defaults to current time)

We decided to work on JSON first. We can still send messages to the server from multiple clients and echo it back,
but we really want to start testing out saving messages to the database via requests from the user.

We're going to work first on making sure that sign up works correctly, which will also let us test whether our
preliminary database strategy works. We'll start working on the client UI in a separate Python file at first,
and we can potentially merge files later if necessary/helpful.
