Today was the "testing phase" of the project. From what I can tell, Waldo sourced his code (or the reverse) from:
https://realpython.com/python-sockets/

Two files were created today:
- server.py
    - main loop
    - accept wrapper
    - service connection
- client.py
    - main loop
    - start connection
    - server connection

Logging has been set up with time stamps.

You run each with the following commands for testing:
"python3 server.py 127.0.0.1 65432"
"python3 client.py 127.0.0.1 65432"

You are currently able to send messages from client to server, and the server can respond.
It might be worth spending time abstracting a lot for our protocol and creating a "protocol.py" file for parsing functions.
